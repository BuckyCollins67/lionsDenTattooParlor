# Lions Den Tattoo Parlor

A mock website for a small business that offers tattoo services. The website is inspired by the many tattoo parlors that can be found in naval towns and cities around the world.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this standalone webpage showcases the web design skills of the creator, including the use of Flexbox for layout and the integration of open source images and videos.

Whether you're a fan of tattoos or simply looking for inspiration for your own small business website, Lions Den Tattoo Parlor provides a visually engaging and informative experience.
